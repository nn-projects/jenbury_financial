# Jenbury Financial  
*A Business Analyst Portfolio Project integrating business insights, system thinking, and data-driven financial management.*

---

## Project Overview  
**Jenbury Financial** is a conceptual fintech solution developed as part of a Business Analyst portfolio project.  
It demonstrates how a Business Analyst can design, document, and validate a data-driven financial management system that supports **online course operations and profitability tracking**.  

The project simulates a digital platform for managing **course income, course payments, and profitability analysis**, while emphasizing BA documentation, data modeling, and stakeholder alignment.

## Business Problem  
Many online education businesses face challenges managing cash flow, tracking marketing ROI, and understanding which courses are most profitable.  
Financial data often exists across multiple tools (payment gateways, ad platforms, and course systems), making it difficult to get a single, accurate picture of business performance.  

**Jenbury Financial** aims to consolidate this information into one structured system that improves financial visibility and decision-making.

## Business Objectives
- Provide a centralized view of all course-related revenue and expenses.  
- Automate reporting on profitability per course.  
- Identify high-performing modules and marketing channels using data insights.  
- Enable consistent financial tracking to maximize profit margins.
